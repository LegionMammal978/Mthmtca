# Mthmtca
A version of Mathematica for golfing purposes. Mthmtca does ***NOT*** stand for *Mthmtca To H&ast;ll Monstrous Traitors Calling "Acronym!"*. The interpreter is currently designed to work with UNIX-like systems.
## Setup
Setup is simple. First, ensure that you have Mono and a working Mathematica kernel installed. Then, just navigate to this directory in a command prompt and execute `make`. *DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES, OR THE INTERPRETER WILL NOT RUN.*
## Usage
To find the index of a symbol, run `./mthmtca <-s|--symbol> <symbol name>`. To run a Mthmtca program, run `./mthmtca [filename]`. If `[filename]` is omitted, then the program will be read from STDIN.
## Specification
WIP. For now, just read the interpreter.
